File Handling 

- File handling is an important part of any web or window application.
- Python has several fun for reading ,writing ,updateing and deleting file.

1) open a file
- the key fun for working with python is the open()
mode

r : read 
w : Writing
a : Append
x : Create 

Example : f = open(" msg.txt',"w");

2) write  data into file
- to write data into file write() is used.

3) close file. 
- We have to close file after creating , appending or reading file.

Ex:
W Py code to write into msg.txt file

f = open(" msg.txt","w")
f.write(" wlcm ")
f.write(" /n hello World")
f.write(" /n hello")
f.close()
print(" File Created ")

4) read data from file
- to read data from file read() is used.


Ex : 
write py code to read msg.txt file.

f = open (" msg.txt","r")
print(f.read())
f.close() 

5) read iine by line

 f = open (" msg.txt")
 for line in f:
	print(line)

f.close()

Python String Formatting

price = 100
item = " MOUSE " 
text =  " item name is {} value of iten is {} "
print(text.format(price,item)
